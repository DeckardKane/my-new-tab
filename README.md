# My New Tab

A simple, clean, custom Chrome new tab page. If you're using the extension from the Chrome app store, all settings are synced across all your devices.

This is me playing with `create-react-app`, React, Redux, yarn. The whole pile / stack.


## Developing

Download and install dependencies:

    $ yarn

Run create-react-app in development mode:

    $ yarn start

Make changes, be mind boggled!


## Building

Run make:

    $ make

This creates the `build/` directory and copies manifest.json into it. If you want to load the unpacked extension, point Chrome at `build/`.
